pxe-deployment
==============

pxe deployment script forked from https://code.google.com/p/pxe-deployment-scripts/

The general goal is to bring the project back to life and improve overall functionality. 
In future the script will (most likely) be modular, so maintaining fresh distro list and adding your own distro is reasonably easy. 

This is my first bash anything, this is most likely ugly, inefficient, badly written, poisonous and makes you blind
